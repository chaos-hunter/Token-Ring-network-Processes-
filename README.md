The program simulates a Token Ring network using multiple Unix processes, shared memory, and semaphores. It consists of a parent process that initializes the simulation, forks child processes to represent nodes, generates random packets for nodes to send, and monitors the simulation until termination. Each node process waits for the token to send pending packets or forwards the token if no packets are available, while also receiving and processing data packets addressed to it. Shared memory is used to store the ring buffer, pending packets, and counters for sent/received packets, acting as the communication medium between nodes. Semaphores ensure synchronized access to shared memory, preventing race conditions during packet transmission and token passing.
Program contains three files the main, the setup and the header file, the setup cotains all the functions required, the program was built up using the talker code given in the examples from the linux server.
Running the code type in make which generates the executable tokensim, then run it by typing ./tokensim followed by the unique id code, then go to a new terminal window run it the same unique id code to make the program run fully.
